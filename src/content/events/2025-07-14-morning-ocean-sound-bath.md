Join us for a sound bath to reset and relax your mind, body, and spirit — reconnecting with your mana and the healing rhythms of the moana.

## Before You Arrive
Consider moving your body beforehand; take a gentle walk, stretch, or run before the session to release stagnant energy.

## Bring
- Towel, mat, or blanket for the ‘āina
- Eye mask if you wish to shut out visual stimulation and the sun
- Swimsuit, sunscreen, and water bottle if you feel called to connect with the moana after our gathering

Let the makani (breeze) and sounds of the moana guide your naʻau (inner heart) into deep rest.

E komo mai — all are welcome!
