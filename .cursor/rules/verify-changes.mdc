# Verify All Code Changes

Every code change MUST be verified by running `npm run dev` to ensure the application builds and runs correctly.

## Required steps:
1. Make your code change
2. Run `npm run dev` immediately after any change
3. Verify the application loads without errors
4. If the application fails to build or run properly, revert your changes and try again

## Key files:
- [astro.config.mjs](mdc:astro.config.mjs) - Astro configuration 
- [tailwind.config.mjs](mdc:tailwind.config.mjs) - Tailwind configuration
- [src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro](mdc:src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro) - Main layout component
- [src/styles/global.css](mdc:src/styles/global.css) - Global styles including Tailwind imports

## Current issue:
There's an error with the Tailwind configuration. When modifying the configuration, always verify the changes work before proceeding.
