# Simplify Tailwind Configuration

The project requires a simpler Tailwind configuration to run properly.

## Current Issues:
- The project is trying to use `@tailwindcss/vite` but this is causing build failures
- Need to switch to the standard `@astrojs/tailwind` integration approach

## Requirements:
1. Always use the official Astro integration for Tailwind
2. Keep configuration minimal - don't overcomplicate
3. After any change to Tailwind config, MUST run `npm run dev` to verify
4. If build fails, revert changes immediately

## Key files:
- [astro.config.mjs](mdc:astro.config.mjs) - Update to use official integration
- [src/styles/global.css](mdc:src/styles/global.css) - Ensure proper Tailwind imports
