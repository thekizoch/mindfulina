[] have google calendar events sync events
  [] create a free Eventbrite event with the eventrite api
  [] make the event on the site that links to it
  
  
  [] make it themed like in whatsapp chat
  
  [] have html created from markdown. so no need for html template.
  
[] format site so past events are not shown on homepage. if no future events, show a link to past events and some default like 'check back again for more events'
[] future events shoud truly be in the future, not just all events ever...
